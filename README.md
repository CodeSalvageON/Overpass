https://vault0.netlify.app is the website this code is working on, by the way.

## How to Use
* Go to the website above
* Get the question from your diagnostic (ie. Which table represents a function?)
* Type the question into the box next to "Question"
* Press the button next to the input box or press the ENTER/RETURN key.
* Check the probability of the answer (you'll see it).
* If the probability is low, don't give up! Check the answer URLs for any relevant answers.
* Click on one of the answer links to get your answer!

## Disclaimer
* This is intended to be more of a search function, so don't expect to get answers automatically.
